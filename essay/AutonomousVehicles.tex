\section{Social and Ethical Implications of AVs}

\subsection{Everyday Life and Social Implications}
\cite{Rand:16}
\begin{itemize}
\item most likely \textbf{changed patterns of land use}: low-density patterns of land-use surrounding metropolitan regions due to facilitated mobility.  
\item \textbf{Mobility for those unable or unwilling to drive}: independence, reduction of social isolation, ... possibly connect this to the gap between rich and poor.
\item \textbf{energy and emissions}: the overall effect is unclear, total VMT will likely increase, but the technology offers the possibility to decrease emissions as well. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Economics}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gap between rich and poor}: AVs will likely be very expensive until they have become ``mainstream'', so this possibly safe, fast and reliable and convenient mean of transportation might be only available to the richer parts of the population, increasing said gap. Compare \cite[p. 39]{Rand:16}
\item \textbf{Lost jobs}: A variety of professions related to the classical automobile industry will likely be affected by the introduction of AVs: People working in transportation and logistics, insurances, ... Since AVs could facilitate the introduction of alternative fuels (or this might happen simultaneously anyway), jobs related to combustion enginges might be lost as well. My personal prediction: More jobs will be rendered obsolete by AVs than new jobs will be created. Possible policy reactions might be discussed here, even radical ones like an unconditional income. Compare \cite[p. 40ff]{Rand:16}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Legal}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Liability implications}: The manufacturer's liability will likely increase (danger (discussion?) of slowdown of technology adoption). This might lead to \textbf{vehicles as a service}. \textbf{Closer monitoring of driver behaviour} is mentioned in the RAND report as well, this might be a point of discussion.
\item \textbf{Policy toolkit}: federal insurance backstop, or simply assign liability to human drivers? \textit{tort preemption??}
\end{itemize}
